SHM Vim Cheatsheet

- [Vim Sessions](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/09/10/vim-sessions/)
- [Vim Movements via Thoughtbot](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/vim-splits-move-faster-and-more-naturally)
- Vim Diff
  - to diff two tabs in the current window --> :windo diffthis
  - to end diff mode --> :diffoff!
- Re-Syntax Highlight current buffer --> autocmd BufEnter * :syntax sync fromstart
Vim has a built-in re-formatter for whitespace. Visually select some text and use the = key to re-indent all of it.
- :%s/foo/bar/gc --> Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first
- check GUI Font --> :set guifont?
