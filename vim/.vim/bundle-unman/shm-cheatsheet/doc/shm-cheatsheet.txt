SHM Vim Cheatsheet

- [Vim Sessions](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/09/10/vim-sessions/)
- [Vim Movements via Thoughtbot](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/vim-splits-move-faster-and-more-naturally)
- Vim Diff
  - to diff two tabs in the current window --> :windo diffthis
  - to end diff mode --> :diffoff!
- Re-Syntax Highlight current buffer --> autocmd BufEnter * :syntax sync fromstart
Vim has a built-in re-formatter for whitespace. Visually select some text and use the = key to re-indent all of it.
- :%s/foo/bar/gc --> Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first
- check GUI Font --> :set guifont?

Mark Motions
- go to last change: `.
    - The ` goes to a mark, and . is a "special" mark which is automatically set to the position where the last change was made.
- go back to where the cursor was before you made your last jump: ``
- this is the position where the cursor was the last time when insert mode was stopped: `^
- :help mark-motions

- move between positions in the change list: g; and g,

You can also use ' (apostrophe) instead of ` (backtick)

- increment the next number: Ctrl-A (normal mode)
- decrement the next number: Ctrl-X (normal mode)
- The number can be at the cursor, or to the right of the cursor (on the same line).
